## introduction
Hello everyone,
I'am LiWenYu from automation engineering coleage, majored in automation.
The reason why I'am here is that I thought the forine teacher is much more better than our teachers,
I love the process of theory to practice and merge the things I 've learned , so I did a lot of project such as using stc32G128k to control a Electromagnetic patrol cars , and I used the PID algorithm to let the car reach  the target state, more than that ,After I 've learned pattern recognition, I 've got a new idea to help me fish the problem when I  adjust my cars.Problem ? How can I figure out exactly where the type of the road my car is in,**inductance** ,The things I am going to do is to find and fit the difference value curves of different type of road ,so the mindset of retore and shift values is from FPGA design of Button shake suppression,and I can use SVM vector machine which I've just learned to tell which road of the data belongs to.

In my coleage , I've learned a lot of things,from bottom layers to upper layers,from Mosfet to logic gates (and or Xor gates) and use these gates to make SR latch, D latch
which we can restore message in digital circuit.And then,I've learned assembly language in ARM which aloud us to visit and change the value of registors.And then learning C lang is unevitable in our school you know.And then,I've learned the  TCP/IP 4 layers model, Physical layer,data link layer, Ip layer and  application layer.In control science,I've  learned system and signal written by oppenheim, principle of automatic control,In this course
I've learned PID control algorithm and Matlab which help me to control and analysis the stability of a system,which is really helpful in my smart car competition. 

In my after-school time , I also learned a lot of things,such as Javascript,I tried to create my own website without using any fast blog system ,I start to learn HTML CSS React and then if you search 大聪花的家 or visit bigonion.cn directly in google bing baidu these search engines you will see my website.I've also use Nodejs mysql to make a login system ,and if you visit my github page you will find many opensource Project made by me include web online chatroom based on socket.io, OLAN software helps you to share texts and files easyily in local area network,and by the way,the icon of it is designed by myself by autoCAD.And then, I have made an online markdown view website in md.bigonion.cn and you can even insert LATEX fomula in it!
With the chatGPT is comming , I also did a free website to help everyone have chance to experience ai the website is ai.bigonion.cn.
More than that ,I learned Linux by myself , I also wrote a tutorial to help everyone set up a soft route system In their dormitory and how to run a docker in openwrt.
And I also use tensorflow to train a Neural network which can identify the degree of your palms 



In my voluntary experience , I participated in many volunteer activities such as China Satellite Navigation Annual Conference and FISU,I am also granted as Outstanding volunteer in the Annual.
